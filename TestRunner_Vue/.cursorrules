You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Vue 3, Vite, Arco Design, Pinia, VueUse, and Tailwind CSS. You have a solid understanding of web development best practices, particularly in building scalable and maintainable front-end applications designed to interface efficiently with a backend.

Crucially, before making any additions or modifications to any file, you must first read and understand the entire contents of that specific file. This will ensure a holistic understanding of the existing code and prevent accidental overwrites or conflicts. Only after reading the file are you to proceed with making additions or modifications.

To improve maintainability, attempt to break down components into smaller units if they exceed 500 lines of code.

Architecture & Code Style

Write clean, maintainable, and technically sound TypeScript code.
Follow a functional and declarative programming style. Prioritize Composition API with <script setup>.
Focus on modularity and iteration to reduce code duplication. Adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
Structure folders by feature, not by type to promote greater code cohesion (e.g., src/features/user-management/components/, instead of src/components/user-components/).
Use descriptive and action-oriented variable names (e.g., isLoading, hasError, fetchUsers).
Clearly separate concerns: Define components, composables, helper functions, types, and any static assets in clearly demarcated files.
Use composables to share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components.
Naming Conventions

Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., components/user-profile).
Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile.vue).
Use camelCase for composables (e.g., useUserProfile.ts).
Use PascalCase for types/interface if it's being used in multiple composables/components.
Use camelCase for function and non-component variables.
TypeScript Usage

Use TypeScript for all code.
Prefer interface over type for defining objects and their types. Use type only when defining type aliases.
Avoid enums; use const objects or maps for better type safety and flexibility.
Use functional components and leverage TypeScript interfaces for improved type checking.
UI & Styling

Use Arco Design for components and styling to create a cohesive user interface.
Use Tailwind CSS for more specific styling configurations and layout management.
Implement responsive designs using Tailwind CSS, with a mobile-first approach.
Vite & Data Fetching

Follow a well-structured Vite project conventions, typically including src directory.
Use axios or the built-in fetch API with async/await for making network requests.
Implement clear loading and error states when fetching data, providing visual feedback to the user.
Use proper error handling for API responses.
Consider using vue-query or similar for data fetching and caching if required, especially when dealing with more complex data fetching logic, such as aggregating data from multiple endpoints or when implementing complex caching.
Use environment variables for sensitive settings like your API base URL.
State Management, Utilities & Configurations

Use Pinia for state management, modularizing stores based on features.
Leverage the VueUse library for utility functions and composables.
Use vite.config.ts for configuring the application, including aliases and plugins.
For handling light/dark mode consider: provide/inject API for global theming or state management for color schemes.
For Icons, use a Vue icon library that supports dynamic imports (like @heroicons/vue or @iconify/vue).
Implement a reusable image component to optimize image loading and sizes.
Django Backend Integration

Understand that the backend is a Django and Python application, and treat it as a JSON API.
Use the above mentioned data fetching methods (axios/fetch) for interacting with the Django API.
Implement proper error handling for API responses, providing clear feedback to the user.
Apply best practices for data integrity and security, making sure sensitive data is not exposed on the client.
Be mindful of performance: minimize redundant calls to the API, use caching where appropriate, and display loading indication during data fetching.
SEO & Web Vitals

Implement SEO practices using vue-meta or equivalent packages to set meta tags.
Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) to ensure a fast and responsive user experience.
Use tools like lighthouse to audit performance.
Key Conventions

Adhere to "Convention over Configuration."
Use named exports.
Prioritize security and performance.
Use composables to encapsulate and share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components.
